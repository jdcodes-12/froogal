# Froogal - Your Personal Finance App

## What Is Froogal?

### The Problem
> Financial literacy is the cornerstone of wealth building. As one begins their
financial journey, he is sure to come across a very powerful tool - the budget.
The budget's strength stems from the ability to have control over one's spending
by tracking incoming and outgoing cashflow; moreover, it allows spending boundaries
to be established by setting spending limits for a certain period. However, the
budget by itself is not sufficient due to its lack of highlighting spending
habits. Setting estimated spending limits is great in practice, but in reality
they do not reflect the spender at his core. 

### The Solution
> **Froogal** was created on the ambition of wanting to make personal finance more
***personal***. The app aims to provide insights in to one's spending, by allowing them
to track more than just incoming and outgoing cashflow. It provides a platform
where a user can monitor their purchases item-by-item. Thus, allowing a user to 
visually see where their money is going at an atomic level. These insights are
useful in reflecting on personal spending habits; ultimately revealing where
one can reduce spending and allocate that money elsewhere.
